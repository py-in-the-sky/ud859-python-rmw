    <pre><code>
        def function(a):

            def f1(a, b):
                a[b] = (a.get(b) or 0) + 1
                return a

            return map(lambda a: a[0],

                              reduce(f1, a, {}).items()))
    </code></pre>

    <h2 id="Discussion">Discussion:</h2>
    <p>
        The function above will return a list of unique items, each being an item of
        <code>a</code> that occurs at least twice in <code>a</code>.  So, for example, <code>function([1, 2, 1])</code> will
        return the list <code>[1]</code> because <code>1</code> occurs twice in the input but <code>2</code> occurs only once.  The input <code>a</code>
        must be a Python iterable with all elements being immutable types.  If the
        input <code>a</code> is not an iterable, then an error will be raised because the call to
        <code>reduce</code> expects that <code>a</code> be an iterable.  Furthermore, if any element of <code>a</code> is
        mutable, an error will be raised because the function <code>f1</code> will try to make each
        item from <code>a</code> be a key in a dictionary, and Python's default behavior requires
        that only immutable objects be used as dictionary keys.
    </p>
    <p>
        This paragraph explains how the function works when <code>a</code> is an iterable.  We'll start with the
        most deeply nested function call: <code>reduce(f1, a, {})</code>.  This function call returns
        a dictionary where each key is an element of <code>a</code> and the corresponding value is
        the count of times that the element occurs in <code>a</code>.  Then the method call to <code>items</code>
        returns a list of (element, count) tuples that <code>filter</code> then iterates over.
        <code>filter</code> then checks the second value (i.e., the count) in each tuple and
        keeps the tuple if the second value is not <code>1</code>; by the definition of <code>f1</code>, all counts will be
        <code>1</code> or greater, so the call to <code>filter</code> will result in a list of (element, count)
        tuples where count is greater than <code>1</code>.  Then the call to <code>map</code> will take this list
        of (element, count) tuples and convert it to a list containing just the elements.  Finally, <code>function</code>
        will return the result of the call to <code>map</code>: a list of all the elements of <code>a</code>
        that occur at least twice in <code>a</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A clearer, equivalent function, <code>get_repeated_items</code>, is presented below.  It uses the Counter class
        from the collections module of the Python standard library.  The comments in
        the code explain what each line does.  I believe this new function is clearer for several
        reasons.  First, more variables are used.  That is, instead of having multiple
        nested function calls, the results of the functions are stored in variables,
        and this lets the reader digest a smaller amount of logic per line of code and more easily
        reason about how it all works together.
        Second, the variable, argument, and function names are more semantic; they describe
        what values or behavior they refer to, making it easier to read through the code without
        having to refer back to earlier lines to remind oneself of the meaning of a variable.
        Third, the use of functions and classes from the Python standard library, instead of writing our own, allows the
        code to be more concise.  For example, using <code>Counter(itr)</code> allows us to replace
        the more verbose definition of <code>f1</code> as well as the call <code>reduce(f1, a, {})</code>.
        Fourth, the use of a list comprehension replaces separate calls to <code>map</code>
        and <code>filter</code> and presents the mapping and filtering choices more clearly and concisely to the reader.
        Fifth, the new function is given a doc string explaining the expected input and output
        of the function, and lines of code are commented, explaining how the function
        accomplishes its work, helping people who may be unfamiliar with how some of the
        objects used inside the function behave.  Finally, a little optimization has
        been added, avoiding unnecessary work on sets and dicts since their
        keys necessarily occur only once each.
    </p>
<!--    <p>
        Just as a matter of good practice, I have added tests to check that <code>get_repeated_items</code>
        has the same behavior as <code>function</code>.

    <h2 id="Performance">Performance</h2>
    <p>
        The runtime and memory complexity of <code>function</code> and
        <code>get_repeated_items</code> is <i>O(n)</i>, or linear, where <i>n</i> is the
        number of items in the iterable input.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, <code>function</code>.  The runtime complexity is linear because
        the input is transformed via a series of functions that are also linear
        in the input size: <code>reduce</code> touches each item of the input once
        and applies the constant-time function <code>f1</code> to each item, resulting
        in a Python dictionary that has at most as many keys as there are items
        in the input <code>a</code>; then the method call <code>items</code> just
        converts this dictionary of element-count pairs to a list of (element, count)
        tuples; then <code>filter</code> touches each tuple from this list once, producing
        a new list that is at most as long as <code>a</code>; finally, <code>map</code>
        takes this list and visits each tuple once, extracting the element from each
        (element, count) tuple, returning a list that is at most as long as <code>a</code>.
        The description above also shows why <code>function</code>'s memory complexity
        is also linear: in the process of generating its output, <code>function</code>
        generates one dictionary and three lists, all of which are no longer than
        the original input <code>a</code>.  So if <code>a</code> has <i>n</i>
        elements, this means <code>function</code>'s memory complexity is at
        most <i>4n</i>, which is <i>O(n)</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now <code>get_repeated_items</code>.  The runtime complexity is linear
        because its input is also transformed via a series of functions that are
        linear in the input size: <code>Counter(itr)</code> visits each element
        of <code>itr</code> once; the method call to <code>iteritems</code> returns
        an iterator that will visit each element-count once; finally, the list
        comprehension visits each element once, checking that the count is greater
        than one and if so including the element in the list.  The memory complexity
        is linear because in the process of generating its output, <code>get_repeated_items</code>
        creates a dictionary that is no longer than <code>itr</code> and a list
        that is no longer than <code>itr</code>.  So if <code>itr</code> has <i>n</i>
        elements, this means the memory complexity is at
        most <i>2n</i>, which is <i>O(n)</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although both functions have the same big-oh performance, we could take
        a more granular view and see that <code>get_repeated_items</code> is somewhat
        better both in terms of runtime and memory.  We can see above that,
        when we don't strip out coefficients with big-oh notation,
        <code>function</code>'s memory usage is at most four times the input size,
        whereas <code>get_repeated_items</code>'s is at most two times.
        Furthermore, by running the profiling code below, we can see that
        <code>get_repeated_items</code> makes fewer function calls and hence has
        to instantiate fewer objects in memory.  Therefore,
        <code>get_repeated_items</code> likely wins out on memory usage.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of runtime performance, I first assumed that <code>get_repeated_items</code>'s
        memory advantage would also translate to a runtime advantage: since it has to spend
        less time instantiating lists, it must save on time.
        The calls to <code>run</code> in the code below showed that <code>function</code>
        takes almost 18 seconds longer than <code>get_repeated_items</code> on
        my computer on an input of size <i>100 * 2**20</i>, which seemed to support my assumption.
        However, the profiling results
        from <code>run</code> showed that the call to <code>reduce</code>
        in <code>function</code> accounts for the 18-second
        difference on my computer.  This suggests that the built-in <code>Counter</code> far
        outperforms the use of <code>reduce</code> and <code>f1</code>.  Since
        both <code>function</code> and <code>get_repeated_items</code> are linear in the input but <code>function</code> seems to
        be slower, the runtime difference between the two functions will likely grow
        linearly with larger inputs.

        <!--, which supports the-->
        <!--argument that although both functions are <i>O(n)</i>, <code>function</code>-->
        <!--has a larger coefficient that will make the time difference between-->
        <!--the two functions grow linearly as the input size grows.-->
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, the for-loops in the code below also provide empirical support for the argument that the
        functions' runtimes grow linearly in the input.  The tests
        are limited because they're all based on multiples of <code>range(100)</code>; however,
        using these inputs, the test do show that the runtimes double as the input size doubles.
